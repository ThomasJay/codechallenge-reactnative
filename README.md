# Code Challenge: React Native
__Cross-platform Mobile Development Skills Assessment__

## Summary
This React Native code challenge provides each candidate a `consistent` and `fair` opportunity to demonstrate the skills they have developed and practiced over their years of software engineering.

Additionally, the challenge allows each candidate the ability to go `above and beyond` to make sure the development manager and team can see their `unique combination` of `skills and abilities` and better understand why they should be the newest member of our amazing team.

The challenge is designed to test the `development skills`, `processes & procedures`, `git workflows`, `methods`, and `problem solving` used on a daily basis during software engineering. It is anticipated that the majority of candidates will `NOT` complete the entirety of this code challenge. 

The extent of the requirements are simply there to provide candidates with options to move forward in the challenge if they become stuck on any one requirement. This also allow the same test to be used to assess developers with skill levels from entry to senior to architect.

Simply do your best to complete as many of the requirements as possible within the time allotted. Don't let this challenge stress you out, we simply want to see what you can do and how you do it!

## Project Description
For this challenge, you will be building a mobile application that utilizes a third-party RESTful API as its data source. The data supplied by the API is related to a few types of cancer and provide details about those cancers to the user. 

The data provided for each cancer are:

- Overview of the cancer
- Treatments
- Causes and Preventions
- Screening Methods
- Coping with Cancer

The basic application allows the user to select a cancer type and is then presented with the details listed above in a user-friendly and easy to digest manner. The focus is to make the application as easy to use as possible, this means intuitive, accessible, and responsive.

This will require:

- Listing the cancers so the user can select them
- Making each cancer selectable
- Navigating to a details view, so they can read the overview
- Listing the various items from each section (treatments, causes and preventions, screening methods, coping with cancer)
- Allowing the user to open and view linked external resources

## Instructions

### Mobile App Setup
We will keep this quite simple.

- [ ] Fork this repository to your own GitHub account 

Verify that the provided default React Native project will:

- [ ] Builds
- [ ] Runs on either an Android or iOS device emulator, or both, it is up to you

### RESTful API Setup
Use the Mock RESTful API as your application's backend. It is found on GitHub at https://github.com/tim-lynn-clark/codechallenge-mock-api

## Requirements

### API Integration
- [ ] Handle common errors associated with asynchronous API calls (i.e. HTTP error responses, failed API calls, etc.)
- [ ] Handle common formatting issues that arise when using a third-party API as a backend (i.e. proper letter casing, empty strings, etc.)
